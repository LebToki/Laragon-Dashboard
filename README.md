# ![Screenshot of Laragon Dashboard Logo](assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png)  How to use

1. Replace the default index.php file in your Laragon root directory with our customized index.php file.
2. your laragon hostname template (.local) will be automatically detected and served here (line 249 is your friend)

```[php]
   function getLocalSites($server = 'apache', $ignoredFiles = ['.', '..', '00-default.conf']): array{}
```

3. Upload the icons and CSS files to the assets directory (or simply import them as is).

4. add whatever directories that you don't intend to expose publicly (line 316)

```[php]
$ignore_dirs = array('.', '..', 'logs', 'access-logs', 'vendor', 'favicon_io', 'assets');
```

5. Configure the mailbox directory by setting the `SENDMAIL_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable or editing `config.php`.

```[php]
$domainSuffix = '.test'; // Set this according to user preference or configuration

switch (true) {
    case file_exists($host . '/wp-admin'):
        $app_name = ' Wordpress ';
        $avatar = 'assets/Wordpress.png';
        $admin_link = '<a href="' . $url . '://' . htmlspecialchars($host) . $domainSuffix . '/wp-admin" target="_blank"><small style="font-size: 8px; color: #cccccc;">' . $app_name . '</small><br>Admin</a>';
        break;
```
